## Server Endpoints

- Create server endpoints for the these functions. We will be returning jokes to requests that our future frontend will make.
- You can name it whatever you like.
- You will use that endpoint from the Frontend `/make-me-laugh` page

## The Frontend

- Write the JS required to capture the user's joke choice.
- Use `onchange` to make it dynamic.
- Once a user selects a joke-type, a random joke should appear on the page.
- If the user re-selects, then the joke changes.
- To get the joke, contact your server ant the endpoint you created and `request` the type of joke the user wants to see.
